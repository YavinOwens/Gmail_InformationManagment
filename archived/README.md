# Archived Files

This folder contains files that were created during development but are no longer needed for the primary working solution.

## üìÅ **Archived Files**

### **Redundant Requirements Files**
- `local_requirements.txt` - Duplicate of `local_requirements_simple.txt`
  - **Reason**: Identical content, keeping the simpler version

### **Docker Files (Python Implementation)**
- `Dockerfile` - Docker configuration for Python application
- `docker-compose.yml` - Docker Compose setup for Python app
  - **Reason**: Not needed for Next.js solution

### **Consolidated Python Workflow Files**
- `gmail_workflow.py` - Original implementation (superseded)
- `gmail_workflow_simple.py` - Simplified version (superseded)
- `gmail_workflow_fixed.py` - Fixed authentication version (superseded)
  - **Reason**: All consolidated into a single comprehensive `gmail_workflow.py` file

## üéØ **Current Working Solution**

The **primary working solution** is the Next.js application in `nextjs-gmail-workflow/`:

```bash
cd nextjs-gmail-workflow
npm install
npm run dev
# Access: http://localhost:3000
```

## üìã **Alternative Solutions**

If you need Python CLI alternatives, these files are still available in the main directory:

- `gmail_workflow.py` - **CONSOLIDATED** Python CLI implementation (combines all previous versions)
- `local_requirements_simple.txt` - Python dependencies
- `local_setup.py` - Python environment setup
- `local_quick_start.sh` - Python quick setup script
- `local_makefile` - Python development tasks

## üîÑ **Consolidation Summary**

The three separate Python workflow files have been consolidated into a single comprehensive implementation that includes:

- **Robust Authentication**: Multiple fallback methods (fixed port, random port, manual)
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Detailed logging and error recovery
- **Configurable Settings**: Environment variable support for all parameters
- **Complete Email Processing**: Optional body extraction, metadata handling
- **Enhanced Logging**: Detailed progress and error reporting

## üöÄ **Recommendation**

Use the **Next.js application** as your primary solution. The consolidated Python script is available if you need command-line functionality.
